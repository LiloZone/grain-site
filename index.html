                        <h4 class="margin-b-50">GRAIN is an investigation inspired by 3 main concepts, the botanical garden (or parks) as a nature library, the sustainable architecture models and the symbiotic relations along plants. The research process will be transformed into an audiovisual installation, with a mapping projection over a mobile paper architecture structure, combining few other elements such as sand, concrete and leaves.
                        </h4>
                        <h5 class="margin-b-50">The Bothanical Garden of Pavol Josef Safarik University will be our main visual source. We will make registers, explores textures, drawings and some species in the garden to experiment manually and digitally to create a video animation. 
                        </h5>
                        <h5 class="margin-b-50">Parallel to the visual research, an investigation on bio architecture will be done. Much of contemporary architecture seeks biological inspiration, whether in the forms or functions in fauna and/or flora. The aim is to create customized structures for an ecosystem. In this sense, observing nature is the best for learning about housing, construction and energy consumption. For example, how does a seed know all its algorithm for creating a tree and generate fruits?
                        </h5>
                        <h5 class="margin-b-50">A symbiotic affinity can be defined as a mutual beneficial relationship, and that is the one we are interested in create and investigate. How can we learn from nature to build cities with more symbiotic relations among man, plants, concrete and machines?
                        </h5>
                        <h5 class="margin-b-50">An urban environment has too many variables, but when a problem is scaled and fits all within our field of vision, it is easier to select, understand, interact and improve ideas, observing all aspects. In that way, we will work with paper models, not to reproduce a city structure, but to simplify a format of building, creating abstract configurations that will be mapped with the video mentioned above. That model is a projected mobile model, working as a pop-up green hypothetical city-bioma.

When a problem is scaled and fits all within our field of vision, it is easier to understand, interact and improve ideas, observing all aspects. For this we created several technologies: calculators, telescopes, lasers, cameras, etc. But technological devices alone are nothing. So, to understand and work with technologies, we create  languages, subtitles, libraries, internet, etc.

A model mapped then, is a physical object that represents the world in a playful way, it is a small augmented reality to the naked eye that opens a physicall space beyond digital. And, perhaps because it relates so many real and virtual layers, it is possible to look at the problem and imagine other futures combining technologies and re-creating languages.
